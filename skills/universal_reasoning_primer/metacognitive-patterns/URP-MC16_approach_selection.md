# URP-MC16: Approach Selection

**Type:** Meta-Cognitive Pattern (Tier 3)
**Function:** Choosing optimal approach before task execution
**Domain Independence:** Universal across problem-solving and performance domains
**Orchestration Role:** Matches task demands to available methods for efficiency

## Pattern Definition

### Trigger Condition
Situations involving:
- Novel tasks with multiple possible approaches
- Familiar tasks where standard approach may not be optimal
- Resource constraints requiring efficient method choice
- High-stakes situations where approach quality matters
- Time pressure requiring upfront optimization

### Core Procedure

1. **Task Feature Analysis**
   - What are the key characteristics of this task?
   - What makes it easy or hard?
   - What constraints apply (time, resources, quality)?
   - What's the success criterion?

2. **Approach Inventory**
   - What methods could I use for this?
   - What have I seen work for similar tasks?
   - What approaches do experts use?
   - What novel combinations might work?

3. **Match Evaluation**
   - Which approach fits task features best?
   - Which plays to my strengths?
   - Which fits available resources?
   - Which has best risk/reward profile?

4. **Approach Testing (if possible)**
   - Can I probe approaches before committing?
   - What would quick pilot reveal?
   - Are there early indicators of approach fit?
   - What's the cost of testing vs. choosing wrong?

5. **Commitment with Monitoring Plan**
   - Select approach with clear rationale
   - Define success indicators for chosen approach
   - Plan checkpoints for approach evaluation
   - Identify switch triggers if approach fails

### Expert Heuristic

> "The time spent selecting the right approach is almost always less than the time wasted on the wrong one. Ten minutes of approach analysis can save hours of misdirected effort."

## Evidence from Literature

### Example 1: Strategy Selection
**Context:** Siegler (1996) adaptive strategy choice
**Evidence:** Skilled performers select strategies based on problem features, not habit
**Insight:** Approach selection is learned and can be taught

### Example 2: Expert Problem Solving
**Context:** Chi et al. (1981) expert-novice differences
**Evidence:** Experts spend more time on problem representation before solving
**Insight:** Upfront analysis, including approach selection, distinguishes expertise

### Example 3: Means-Ends Analysis
**Context:** Newell & Simon (1972) problem-solving research
**Evidence:** Effective problem-solving involves matching operators to goal distances
**Insight:** Approach selection is matching available methods to problem structure

## Decision Criteria

**Criterion 1: Task-Approach Fit**
- IF task features match approach strengths, THEN prefer that approach
- IF mismatch on critical features, THEN seek alternatives
- Rationale: Fit determines efficiency and success probability

**Criterion 2: Resource Fit**
- IF approach requires unavailable resources, THEN eliminate it
- IF approach fits available resources well, THEN prefer it
- Rationale: Resource mismatch causes failure regardless of theoretical fit

**Criterion 3: Expertise Match**
- IF I'm skilled at an approach, THEN weight it higher
- IF approach requires skills I lack, THEN account for learning cost
- Rationale: Personal capability affects actual (not theoretical) effectiveness

**Criterion 4: Robustness**
- IF task has high uncertainty, THEN prefer flexible approaches
- IF task is well-defined, THEN optimize for efficiency
- Rationale: Uncertainty requires adaptability; certainty allows optimization

## Contrast with Naive Approaches

**Naive Approach**: Use first approach that comes to mind; habit over analysis.
**Expert Approach**: Survey options, match to task, then commit.

**Naive Approach**: Use favorite approach regardless of task features.
**Expert Approach**: Select based on fit, even if less familiar.

**Naive Approach**: Jump into execution; figure it out as you go.
**Expert Approach**: Invest upfront in approach selection to save downstream effort.

**Naive Approach**: Commit fully without checkpoints.
**Expert Approach**: Select with planned evaluation points to catch mismatches early.

## Integration with Pattern Tiers

### As Orchestration Operator

URP-MC16 functions as a **method-task matcher**:

```
INPUT: Task + available approaches + resources + constraints
  ↓
URP-MC16: Select approach
  ↓
EVALUATION:
  - Task feature analysis
  - Approach repertoire
  - Fit assessment (task, resource, personal)
  - Risk/reward evaluation
  ↓
OUTPUT: Selected approach + rationale + monitoring plan
```

### Composition with Other MC Patterns

**Foundation Relationships:**
- **URP-MC16 + URP-MC15**: Goal decomposition informs approach requirements
- **URP-MC16 + URP-MC12**: Depth calibration affects approach selection
- **URP-MC16 → URP-MC34**: Approach selection is high-level strategy selection
- **URP-MC16 + URP-MC29**: Approach choice affects effort allocation

**Activation Patterns:**
- URP-MC15 (goal decomposition) provides input to URP-MC16
- URP-MC16 informs URP-MC29 (effort allocation) about expected demands
- URP-MC16 outputs feed URP-MC1 (progress monitoring) criteria

## Expertise Level Indicators

| Level | URP-MC16 Application |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Novice** | Uses default approach; no systematic selection; habit-driven |
| **Competent** | Some approach awareness; selects when prompted; basic matching |
| **Expert** | Systematic selection; good task-approach matching; considers tradeoffs |
| **Master** | Rapid accurate matching; knows approach boundaries; creative combinations |
| **Sage** | Develops new approaches; teaches selection principles; meta-optimizes |

## Theoretical Foundations

- **Adaptive Strategy Choice**: Selection based on problem and person features (Siegler, 1996)
- **Problem Space Theory**: Matching operators to problem structure (Newell & Simon, 1972)
- **Expert Problem Representation**: Upfront analysis before solving (Chi et al., 1981)
- **Means-Ends Analysis**: Reducing goal-state difference through operator selection (Newell & Simon, 1972)
