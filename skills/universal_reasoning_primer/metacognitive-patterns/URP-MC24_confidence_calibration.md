# URP-MC24: Confidence Calibration

**Type:** Meta-Cognitive Pattern (Tier 3)
**Function:** Aligning subjective confidence with objective accuracy
**Domain Independence:** Universal across all judgment and decision contexts
**Orchestration Role:** Governs how confidently to hold and express beliefs

## Pattern Definition

### Trigger Condition
Situations involving:
- Any judgment where confidence level matters
- Decisions based on uncertain information
- Communication requiring uncertainty expression
- Domains where overconfidence has costs
- Self-assessment of knowledge or skill

### Core Procedure

1. **Evidence Assessment**
   - What evidence supports this belief?
   - How strong is the evidence?
   - What's the source quality (URP-MC6)?
   - What contrary evidence exists?

2. **Base Rate Consideration**
   - How often are beliefs like this correct?
   - What's my track record in this domain?
   - Am I in a domain prone to overconfidence?
   - What do calibration studies suggest?

3. **Confidence Adjustment**
   - Should I adjust up or down from initial feeling?
   - Am I prone to over- or under-confidence here?
   - What would a well-calibrated person conclude?
   - Does my confidence match the evidence?

4. **Uncertainty Expression**
   - How do I communicate appropriate uncertainty?
   - What range or probability conveys true confidence?
   - Am I distinguishing what I know from what I believe?
   - Am I being appropriately humble or assertive?

5. **Calibration Tracking**
   - Was I right when I was confident?
   - Was I wrong when I was uncertain?
   - Where are my calibration blind spots?
   - How can I improve calibration over time?

### Expert Heuristic

> "Perfect calibration means when you say you're 80% confident, you're right 80% of the time. Most people are overconfident—when they say 90%, they're right 70%. The first step is knowing your bias direction. The second is applying appropriate correction."

## Evidence from Literature

### Example 1: Overconfidence Research
**Context:** Dunning-Kruger, Lichtenstein, Fischhoff studies
**Evidence:** People are systematically overconfident, especially in areas of low competence
**Insight:** Overconfidence is the default; calibration requires active correction

### Example 2: Expert Calibration
**Context:** Tetlock (2005) forecasting research
**Evidence:** Good forecasters are well-calibrated; they update appropriately and express uncertainty
**Insight:** Calibration is trainable and distinguishes expert judgment

### Example 3: Domain Variation
**Context:** Keren (1991) calibration across domains
**Evidence:** Calibration varies by domain; some domains foster overconfidence more than others
**Insight:** Calibration strategies must be domain-aware

## Integration with Pattern Tiers

### As Orchestration Operator

URP-MC24 functions as a **belief confidence governor**:

```
INPUT: Belief/judgment + evidence + domain + track record
  ↓
URP-MC24: Calibrate confidence
  ↓
EVALUATION:
  - Evidence strength
  - Source quality (from URP-MC6)
  - Base rates
  - Personal bias patterns
  ↓
OUTPUT: Calibrated confidence level + appropriate expression
  ↓
TRACK: Outcome vs. confidence → update calibration
```

### Composition with Other MC Patterns

**Foundation Relationships:**
- **URP-MC6 → URP-MC24**: Source quality informs appropriate confidence
- **URP-MC4, URP-MC5 → URP-MC24**: FOK and JOL feed into calibration
- **URP-MC24 + URP-MC39**: Uncertainty tracking and confidence calibration are complementary
- **URP-MC24 + URP-MC40**: Knowledge boundaries inform confidence limits

**Activation Patterns:**
- URP-MC24 activates whenever expressing confidence or making decisions
- URP-MC24 receives input from all monitoring patterns (URP-MC1-MC7)
- URP-MC24 gates how strongly to assert beliefs

## Decision Criteria

**Criterion 1: Evidence-Confidence Match**
- IF evidence is strong, THEN high confidence appropriate
- IF evidence is weak or mixed, THEN moderate confidence
- IF evidence absent, THEN low confidence or withhold judgment
- Rationale: Confidence should track evidence

**Criterion 2: Domain Adjustment**
- IF domain is one where I'm typically overconfident, THEN adjust down
- IF domain is well-calibrated for me, THEN trust initial sense
- Rationale: Apply learned corrections

**Criterion 3: Stakes-Appropriate Expression**
- IF high stakes, THEN express uncertainty more explicitly
- IF low stakes, THEN simpler expression acceptable
- Rationale: Uncertainty communication matters more when consequences are large

**Criterion 4: Updating**
- IF new evidence arrives, THEN update confidence appropriately
- IF initial confidence was wrong, THEN learn for future calibration
- Rationale: Calibration is ongoing, not one-time

## Contrast with Naive Approaches

**Naive Approach**: Trust feeling of certainty; if it feels right, it is right.
**Expert Approach**: Recognize feeling of certainty is unreliable; check against evidence and track record.

**Naive Approach**: Express maximum confidence to appear authoritative.
**Expert Approach**: Express calibrated confidence; uncertainty is not weakness.

**Naive Approach**: Same confidence expression across all domains.
**Expert Approach**: Adjust calibration for domain-specific biases.

**Naive Approach**: Never revise confidence once stated.
**Expert Approach**: Update with evidence; changing confidence is rational.

## Expertise Level Indicators

| Level | URP-MC24 Application |
|-------|------------------|
| **Novice** | Systematically overconfident; confidence unrelated to accuracy |
| **Competent** | Some calibration awareness; can identify extreme cases |
| **Expert** | Generally well-calibrated; applies domain corrections |
| **Master** | Excellent calibration; tracks and improves systematically |
| **Sage** | Teaches calibration; designs calibration-supporting environments |

## Theoretical Foundations

- **Overconfidence Research**: Systematic overconfidence in judgment (Fischhoff et al., 1977)
- **Dunning-Kruger Effect**: Incompetence breeds overconfidence (Kruger & Dunning, 1999)
- **Superforecasting**: Calibration as forecasting skill (Tetlock & Gardner, 2015)
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Appropriate uncertainty expression (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979)
